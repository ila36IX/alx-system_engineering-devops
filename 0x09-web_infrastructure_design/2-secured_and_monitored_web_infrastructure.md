### Firewall

**Firewalls** are security mechanisms designed to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

Firewalls can prevent unauthorized access to or from private networks, block malicious traffic, and protect against various cyber threats. They help enforce network security policies and enhance overall system security.

### HTTPS

HTTPS (_Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure_) is a secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transferring data between a user's web browser and a website. It encrypts the data exchanged between the user and the website, providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
