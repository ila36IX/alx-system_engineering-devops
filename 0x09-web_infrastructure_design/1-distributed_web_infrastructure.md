### Load balancer

Load Balancing is the distribution of a set of tasks over different computing units (or related resources), to make the overall process easier to execute and much more efficient. Ensuring no single server bears too much of demand and evenly spreading the load, it improves the responsiveness and availability of applications or websites for the user.

### Advantage of load balancer

Load balancer is giving us advanatages such as:
- Large amount of work are done in some time
- Increase the availabiity of the application by minimizing down times
- Scalability: We can increase or decrease the number of servers on the fly without bringing down the application
